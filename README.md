Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science dedicated to the design, development, testing and maintanance of software applications. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early computing: software development was manual and error-prone, often done by mathematicians.
Structured programming:the principle was introduced to improve code readablity.
The agile movement:the agile manifesto introduced flexible, customer-centric development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning:identify required resources.
Requirements Analysis:gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
Design:plan data flow and system interaction.
Implementation: write and implement the code based on design documents.
Testing: identify and fix bugs before deployment.
Deployment:release the software to staging enviroment.
Maintanance:provide user support and ensure system stability.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: sequental and linear, changes are difficult after initial planning,customer feedback is gathered at the end.
Agile: iterative and incremental, changes can be made anytime as it is flexible, continous feedback from stakeholders.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: is responsible for designing, coding and implementing software applications.
Quality Assurance Engineer:ensures the software meets quality standards before deployment.
Project Manager:oversees the software development process, ensuring timely delivery and alignment with business goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE: increased productivity, debugging and error detection,code management.
Example:vs code is lightweight and supports multiple languages and intergrates with git.
VCS:helps track and manage changes to code, enabling collaboration and rollback features.
Example: Git, most widely used, supports distributed development.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Keeping up with rapid technology changes:dedicate time for continuos learning and follow industry trends.
Meeting tight deadlines:break tasks into smaller amounts of work so that it is simple to manage.
Debugging and troubleshooting issues:use logging and monintoring tools.
Security threats and vulnerabilities: follow security best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: testing individual components or fuctions.
Importance: helps to identify bugs early and reduces debugging costs.

integration: verifies the interaction between integrated modules.
Importance:verifies data flow between different components. 

system testing: checks how whole system behaves.
Importance: ensures that the system meets functional and business requirements.

Acceptance testing: makes sure that the system meets all the users' requirements before it is released.
Importance: reduces the risk of rework after release.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It refers to how you structure the input into something like chatGPT(AI) to get answers whereby it will read the input and be able to read and responds, in other words you can say it is how to effectively collaborate with AI.

Using AI is simple as it gives answers based on what was your prompt and you are able to understand better about the problem as it gives multiple solutions to the problem and you are able to put them into use to solve the problem.
As it generates ideas it improves the innovation and creativity of a person.
Engaging with AI improves understanding in topics you knowledge on.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Prompt: "Wi-Fi error restart fix"
In making it easy to understand it means when connecting to the Wi-Fi, immediately after coonecting the PC forces restart and after the restart you go on with the same thing of connecting to the wifi from scratch and the problem keeps on occuring so it never connects. 
The improved prompt is effective as it gives the AI a clear understanding of the problem and it is able to give relevant solutions which will make it quick to resolve the issue.
